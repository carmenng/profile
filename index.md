I bring a unique mix of expertise in **AI research and data science** (Center for AI & Digital Policy, ODI, MIT), **thought leadership communications** specializing in AI and digital innovation (Siemens), and **journalism** with **user-centric curation experience** (Reuters). My cross-disciplinary expertise — honed over a decade of work experience in Europe and Asia — enables me to work effectively with data scientists on AI projects, anticipate policy considerations, collaborate with corporate and media stakeholders, and lead cross-team innovation initiatives.

I also host **learning workshops on AI risks and governance** for product, communications and governance teams, as well as for public education in both Chinese and English. Whether it's educating corporate teams on ethical AI practices or informing the public about AI risks in real-world examples, I tailor the materials to suit the specific audience, cultural language and sector domains (energy, smart cities, media), promoting intercultural AI development. Please reach out if you have any enquiries.
