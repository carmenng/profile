I bring a unique mix of expertise in **AI research** (Center for AI & Digital Policy, ODI, MIT), **thought leadership communications** specialised in AI and digital technologies in infrastructure and industry (Siemens), and **breaking news journalism** (Reuters). With over a decade of cross-disciplinary experience in Europe and Asia, I work effectively across domains to:  

- Collaborate with data scientists/business teams on AI projects  
- Anticipate and address policy considerations  
- Lead cross-team innovation initiatives  
- Translate complex topics into impactful narratives for diverse audiences  

I also host **learning workshops on AI risks and governance** (in Chinese & English) for corporate teams, public education, intercultural development. I tailor the materials to suit the specific audience, cultural language and sector domains (energy, smart cities, media). Feel free to connect for inquiries 🙌
